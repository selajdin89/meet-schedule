# Booking Implementation Options

## Current Situation

OnceHub API **does NOT support** creating bookings via POST requests. Their `/v2/bookings` endpoint only supports GET (reading existing bookings).

## Option 1: Use OnceHub (Current Choice)

**How it works:**

- User fills form in your app
- Redirects to OnceHub's booking calendar
- User completes booking on OnceHub's site

**Pros:**

- You already have OnceHub account
- Professional booking interface
- Email notifications handled

**Cons:**

- User leaves your app
- No way to create bookings programmatically
- Limited customization

## Option 2: Switch to Calendly (Recommended for your needs)

**How it works:**

- Calendly has a robust REST API
- Supports creating bookings via POST
- Can embed their calendar widget in your app

**API Example:**

```javascript
POST https://api.calendly.com/scheduled_events
{
  "event_type": "your_event_uuid",
  "invitee": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe"
  },
  "scheduled_at": "2025-10-30T10:00:00Z"
}
```

## Option 3: Build Custom Booking System

**How it works:**

- Use Google Calendar API or Microsoft Outlook API
- Build your own booking interface
- Create events programmatically

**Pros:**

- Complete control
- Fully integrated in your app
- Professional calendars (Gmail/Outlook)

**Cons:**

- More development required
- Need to handle conflicts yourself
- Need to set up email notifications

## Option 4: Embed OnceHub Widget

**How it works:**

- Use iframe to embed OnceHub booking form
- Stay on your page
- Still uses OnceHub's UI

## My Recommendation

Since you want users to book **directly in your app** without leaving, I recommend:

1. **Short term:** Use the redirect approach (implemented now)
2. **Best solution:** Switch to **Calendly** API which supports programmatic booking creation

Would you like me to:

- A) Implement Calendly integration?
- B) Keep the redirect solution?
- C) Create a custom booking system?
